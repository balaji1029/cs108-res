Once there was a student named student_name, with roll number roll_no. Teacher gave results of some 
tests today but she seemed disappointed with student_name. Teacher said, "student_name, what happened 
to you ? You were the best of the best ! And now that I conducted the first test after the summer 
break, you have performed much poorly than before." student_name said, "Ma'am, I will improve !". 
student_name worked hard and hard everyday until one day, the roll number roll_no stood at the top of 
the school !!
